# Verified Quantum Computing in Lean (vqc_in_lean)

**vqc_in_lean** is a Lean 4 port of the [Verified Quantum Computing (VQC) project](https://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~caldwellb/posts/2022-09-14-vqc.html), originally implemented using the Coq proof assistant. This project aims to provide a formal foundation for quantum computing and the verification of quantum programs using Lean 4 and mathlib4.

## Overview

> **Note**: This project is created as part of my personal learning journey in Lean 4 and quantum computing. It is not intended for production use or as an officially supported educational resource. Feedback and suggestions are welcome as I refine my understanding of these topics.
